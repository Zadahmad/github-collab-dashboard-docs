### ✅ 🚀 Deployment Workflow

- Developer pushes code → triggers **GitHub Actions**.
- Tests, builds, and Docker images are created.
- Images are pushed to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)** pulls and deploys updated containers.
- **Prometheus + Grafana** monitor live system performance.
- Logs are collected and analyzed through the **ELK Stack**.


### ✅ 🌟 Advanced Features
